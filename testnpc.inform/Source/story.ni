"testnpc" by Brent Scott

Example Location is a room. 

Location Two is a room. 

Laptop is a thing in Location Two. 

Toy is a thing in Example Location. 

NPC is a male person in Example Location. 

Understand "person in the aisle seat" as NPC. 
Understand "seatmate" as NPC. 
Understand "person" as NPC. 

Instead of giving the Toy to NPC:
	say "The man thanks you and takes you to the other room";
	remove toy from play;
	move player to Location Two.
